              What would eventually become
              <span style="background-color: yellow">The Great Inflation</span>
              reached its first peak of 5.8 percent in 1970. The US economy was
              also in recession at the time. Even though fall in demand usually
              leads to fall in inflation, the CPI spike wasn't done.

              Just as the US came out of the recession, inflation reached a new
              high, increasing by 11.1 percent. Just like today, there were gas
              shortages in the US in 1974 caused by the
              <span style="background-color: yellow">oil embargo</span> of the
              Arab members of OPEC as a retaliation for the

              The highest inflation of the last 50 years came in 1980 at 13.5
              percent. The worth of the dollar had depreciated that
              <span style="background-color: yellow">$100 in 1970</span> had the
              same purchasing power as
              <span style="background-color: yellow">$208.5 in 1980.</span> The
              rampant inflation which peaked that year was blamed on
              <span style="background-color: yellow">the oil crisis</span> of
              the era,

              and a policy that hoped that higher prices would lead to higher
              wages. What followed was a decade of stability as inflation
              plummetted.

              After one decade of inflation consistently plummetting, the
              <span style="background-color: yellow">US Monetary Policy</span>
              of the 90s up until the present yielded a stretch of stable
              inflation from 1990 when inflation rose slightly to 5.4 percent.

      Inflation currently stands at a 40-year high. The June 2022 figures just
      released shows a 9.1 percent year-on-year inflation rate, the highest
      since 1981.

      While the dollar has lost some of its purchasing power domestically, it
      has increased in value against major international currencies. For
      instance,

      the dollar achieved rate parity against the Euro.
