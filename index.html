              On May 23, the Philippine currency pierced through the 58 to a
              dollar level for the first time in two years. The following day,
              it hit 58.13 against the greenback.

              What would eventually become
              <span style="background-color: yellow">The Great Inflation</span>
              reached its first peak of 5.8 percent in 1970. The US economy was
              also in recession at the time. Even though fall in demand usually
              leads to fall in inflation, the CPI spike wasn't done.

              Just as the US came out of the recession, inflation reached a new
              high, increasing by 11.1 percent. Just like today, there were gas
              shortages in the US in 1974 caused by the
              <span style="background-color: yellow">oil embargo</span> of the
              Arab members of OPEC as a retaliation for the
              <span style="background-color: yellow">Arab-Israeli war.</span>

              The highest inflation of the last 50 years came in 1980 at 13.5
              percent. The worth of the dollar had depreciated that
              <span style="background-color: yellow">$100 in 1970</span> had the
              same purchasing power as
              <span style="background-color: yellow">$208.5 in 1980.</span> The
              rampant inflation which peaked that year was blamed on
              <span style="background-color: yellow">the oil crisis</span> of
              the era,
              <span style="background-color: yellow"

              >
              and a policy that hoped that higher prices would lead to higher
              wages. What followed was a decade of stability as inflation
              plummetted.

          Inflation currently stands at a 40-year high. The June 2022 figures
          just released shows a 9.1 percent year-on-year inflation rate, the
          highest since 1981.

          While the dollar has lost some of its purchasing power domestically,
          it has increased in value against major international currencies. For
          instance,
          <a

            >for the first time in 20 years,</a
          >
          the dollar achieved rate parity against the Euro.
